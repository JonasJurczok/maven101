# Welcome to Maven 101

Welcome to the Maven 101 training course. This course will teach you the basics of maven and how we use it.

## Goal

The goals of this course are as follows:

* Basic project setup
* Overriding properties
* Adding dependencies
* Modifying the build

## Instructions

To complete this session please read the [theoretical introduction](theory.md) first.
After doing so you can find the description of the individual tasks in the tasks menu at the top.

Every single task will deal with one specific aspect of maven.
In the repository you checked out there is a folder named `tasks` that contains folders for the individual tasks
themselves.
If you think the task is completed just run a maven clean verify -PtaskX in the root of the project.
If everything goes well the corresponding task page (as well as the maven build) will give you feedback.

Also you will find a couple of `*.md` files in the task directories. They are used to generate this website so just
ignore them.
