# Basic project setup

The first task is to start from almost nothing and make the project buildable.

Please take a look in the folder `tasks/task1`. You will find a `pom.xml` which is exactly what you will find on the
internet if you search for an example of a pom file.

The task now is to make the project buildable.

If you are ready execute `mvn clean verify -Ptask1` in the root of the project and reload this page.
